# Installation

### Composer (best practice)

```
composer require jonom/silverstripe-environment-awareness
```

See the [packagist listing](https://packagist.org/packages/jonom/silverstripe-environment-awareness) and [installation instructions](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/getting_started/composer/#adding-modules-to-your-project)

### Manually

I promise it's worth your time to learn how to use Composer. If painless updating isn't your thing though you can download and extract this project, rename the module folder 'environment-awareness', place it in your project root and run a dev/build?flush=1.
